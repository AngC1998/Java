### A set is a collection of unordered elements that are unique it cannot contain duplicate values.
### Similar to a bubble it doesn’t know where they are, just knows that they exist there.
### Set are useful since searching within a set is super fast and runs in constant time O(1)
### regardless of how many elements are within whether it is 10000000 elements or 2 elements.
### As opposed to arrays the longer it gets the longer it will take to perform an operation within it
### There are three types of sets: HASH SET, TREE SET, LINKED HASH SET.
### We use a set when we don’t care how many times something exists or where it exists.
### We use sets over arrays because it is faster and simpler to do operation on.
