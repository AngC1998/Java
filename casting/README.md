### The final keyword placed in front of a variable is treated as a constant
### When a datatype of type short is declared It will allocate 2 bytes of memory for the variable.
### Then it will find a different memory location and try to allocate memory for the
### another variable which we do not the know the name and this function is anonymous.
### This process is called implicit casting it is also referred to as automatic conversion.
### Whenever we have a value that can be converted to a bigger data type,
### casting will take place implicitly or automatically. 
### Therefore byte can be converted to short and then a short can be automatically converted to an int.
### Then an int can easily be converted to a long. all the work.
