### Constructor
## Sometimes when we setup a class we want to send it different pieces of information to setup the class
## So my cat class gets name, age and food. However, say I want
## name and age
## or say just name
## A constructor is special type of subroutine called to create an object.
## It prepares the new object for use, often accepting arguments that the 
## constructor uses to set required member variables.
