## A block of code that performs a task
## We can have a function that sends an email to someone, we can have a function that converts someoneâ€™s weight from pounds to kilos. We can have a function that validates user input, etc.
## Function naming IS CAMEL CASE

Function architecture in Java 
#1. We always put the left brace within the same line where we define our function

## Usage

```java
ReturnType nameOfFunction() {

}
```
### Function architecture in Java #2.
```java
void sendEmail() {

}
```
Every Java program should have at least one function and this function is called main.
