#### Main Idea:
```
"Software must be open for enhancement but closed for anyone who wants to modify the behavior or feature"
```

#### How To Tell If We are Violating the principle
```
When you go to the code and modify the existing implementation with a new one to work with a new requirement

e.g. Salesman only works with future potential Truck Buyers and the salesman tells you I want to now
work with Motorcycles Buyers. So you modify the code logic to now work for the potential Motorcycle 
Buyers.

```

### How To Avoid Violating This Principle
```
Use Polymorphism or Inheritance
```
