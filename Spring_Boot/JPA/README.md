## JPA: The relational manager of data in Spring Boot
- Spring Data JPA(Java Persistence API) is a framework that abstracts all of the complexity needed for you to interract with your DBs
- Spring Data JPA is an abstraction on top of JPA and hibernate
- The job of Hibernate is to take any Java Object(data) and then ORM(Object Relational Mapping) is used to map the data to the database
- The java class is represented as a table in my DB
- Spring Data JPA does the heavy lifting for me by reducing the boilerplate code that we have to write
- Spring Data JPA gives me lots of generated queries
- I can access my database without having to write one single line of SQL(Worst Programming Language Ever) thanks to repositories
- I love BTS, BLACKPINK, and TWICE; Jimin is the love of my life.üòç
