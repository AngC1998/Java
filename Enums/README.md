## WHAT EXACTLY ARE ENUMERATIONS AKA ENUM
  Enumerations allow us to have a list of possible values for a variable. Similar to a Switch.
  ```java
  public enum currentSubs{"Bronze", "Silver", "Gold", "Platinum"};
  ```
  As you can see for the variable currentSubs I can have the value set to Bronze OR Silver OR Gold OR Platinum
