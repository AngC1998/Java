A Wrapper class is a class whose object wraps or contains a primitive data
type.

When I convert a primitive data type into an object this process is called
boxing

When I convert an object into its corresponding primitive data type this
is called unboxing.

We use a wrapper class to when an internet connection is required
to communicate between two apps. All wrapper classes constructors take
one to three args

Examples of Wrapper Classes:
- Number
- Character
- Byte
- Short
- Long
- Double
- Float
- Boolean
- Math
